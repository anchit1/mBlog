# Instructions for running the project

To run the project in a development environment, you must have **python** and **django** installed.

To install python on Ubuntu/Mint, run `sudo apt-get install python3`

`python3` should be installed by default on Ubuntu 16.04 and above.

Next, run `sudo apt-get install python3-pip` to install pip.
Then run `pip install django`. This installs django.


Now clone the repository and `cd` into the project folder. Here run `python3 manage.py runserver`. This should start a  development server on `localhost:8000/`. Navigate to this location and you shouldsee the website.
